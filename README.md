# Electronic-voting-machine-using-EEPROM
This project is an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) built with a PIC microcontroller and LCD display. It allows multiple candidates to be voted for and displays the results after voting.

 Features

Voting Process

Each candidate is assigned a push button.

When a button is pressed, the corresponding vote is counted and stored in EEPROM (non-volatile memory).

LCD shows confirmation ("Voted") after each valid vote.

Result Declaration

When the result switch is pressed, the system reads vote counts from EEPROM.

LCD displays votes for each candidate one by one.

Finally, the winner is displayed on the LCD.
Tools & Software

MPLAB IDE / XC8 Compiler → For code development.

Proteus → For circuit simulation.

PIC Microcontroller → Handles voting logic, EEPROM storage, and LCD display.
